# File Type Identifier & Malware Hint Scanner

## Overview

This Python tool identifies the true type of a file by reading its magic bytes (headers) and checks for potential malware indicators. It's designed to help cybersecurity enthusiasts and developers understand file structures and detect disguised malicious files.

## Features

- Detects file type using magic bytes.
- Flags files with mismatched extensions as suspicious.
- Supports common file types: `.exe`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.zip`, etc.
- Optionally computes file hashes (MD5/SHA256) for further analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: `os`, `hashlib`, `struct`, `streamlit`
- **Database**: Optional (SQLite or JSON for logging)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asura-Lord/File-Type-Identifier.git
   cd File-Type-Identifier


Set up a virtual environment:

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source .venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the application:

streamlit run app.py
